## Installation

### Prerequisites

Unity 2018.3.0

Android SDK (if you want to build and deploy to Android)

XCode (if you want to build and deploy to iOS)

### Dependency

None

### Installation Steps

Install Unity 2018.3.0. Make sure to include the iOS module when installing. 
If Unity is already installed you may need to download the iOS module through File / Build Settings 
After cloning this repo, open the repo directory on master through Unity. You may develop through the Unity app. 
Double click the Default Scene and press play in the game tab to see the app in action 

If you want to build to Android, you can download the Android SDK along with Android studio at this link: https://developer.android.com/studio.
Make sure that the path to the SDK is configured correctly. On Mac, the default correct configuration is /Users/<nameOfUser>/Library/Android/sdk and on Windows it's C:\Users\username\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk. 
Then, plug your Android into the computer, select File > Build Settings and make sure Platform is set to Android.
 Then, click Build and Run in the Unity Editor, and you can see any development changes on a real Android device!

If you want to build to iOS, you can download the latest version XCode here: https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
Note that XCode 10 (the latest version of XCode) can only build to iPhones with iOS 12.0+ and the Mac running the build must have OS 10.13.0+. The app is still executable on iOS 8.0.0+ when using prior versions of XCode.
Make sure you have an Apple Developer account (you can create one here: https://appleid.apple.com/account?appId=632&returnUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fdeveloper.apple.com%2Faccount%2F).
In Unity, File > Build Settings and make sure Platform is set to iOS.
Click Build and Run. Unity will take you to XCode, from which you should click the 'Play' arrow in the top left to build and run. Then, you can see development changes on a real iPhone!
