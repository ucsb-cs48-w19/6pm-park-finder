Estero Park
One of the largest parks in Isla Vista, Estero Park is a large complex that runs between Camino Del Sur and Camino Corto. It provides multiple opportunities for active recreation, such as outdoor basketball courts, a playing field, a disc golf course and children’s play equipment. The Isla Vista Teen Center, which offers tutoring, youth activities and a meeting place to local teens, is located in the park at the corner of Estero and Camino Del Sur. Estero park also houses our all organic Community Gardens Project where gardeners may use their plots to grow vegetables, herbs and flowers for their own use. The iconic Red Barn set among the Estero Oaks, a mature grove-preserve in the park, calls back to Isla Vista’s ranch days.
