Estero Park
One of the largest parks in Isla Vista, Estero Park is a large complex that runs between Camino Del Sur and Camino Corto. It provides multiple opportunities for active recreation, such as outdoor basketball courts, a playing field, a disc golf course and children’s play equipment. The Isla Vista Teen Center, which offers tutoring, youth activities and a meeting place to local teens, is located in the park at the corner of Estero and Camino Del Sur. Estero park also houses our all organic Community Gardens Project where gardeners may use their plots to grow vegetables, herbs and flowers for their own use. The iconic Red Barn set among the Estero Oaks, a mature grove-preserve in the park, calls back to Isla Vista’s ranch days.

People's Park
Just to the south of Anisq’Oyo’, alongside Embarcadero Hall, the open lawn and picnic benches of People’s Park provide the perfect place to relax between classes. It also has the practice basket for the Isla Vista Peace Disc Golf Course-where park users can perfect their putting skills.

Perfect Park
This park is located at the base of the Embarcadero Loop. Completed in 1995, Perfect Park was designed and built by community volunteers. Beautifully landscaped with improved paths and native coastal plants, it was intended to be an urban getaway for nature lovers and is ideal for bird watching, contemplation, outdoor reading and picnics. In 2003, the Perfect Park Peace Monument was built to commemorate peace activism in Isla Vista from the 70’s to the present.
